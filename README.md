# Weekly nerd \| Minor web-dev

> Every Tuesday during the Minor developers, from some of the biggest agencies in the Netherlands, came to give a talk about interesting and relevant topics in the development world.

_\*\* side note1: we were supposed to sketchnote. My sketchnotes turned out to be bullitpoints and scribbles _ ¯\\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

_\*\*\* side note2: I ended up missing 3 talks which I did attend so to fix this I added some of my notes from CSSDAY_
