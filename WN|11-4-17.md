## "THE 'S' IN IOT IS FOR SECURITY."
- IoT is easily hackable, because most connections are not secured.
- Niels' house is full of little IoT appliances that make life more "fun".

## House of the future
- Inspired by the house of the future, and wanted to make his life lazy.
- Found a way to check if he has mail in his physical mailbox.
- Found a way to check if the washingmachine is finished.
- Found a way to make sure his chickens never have frozen water in their cage.
- Are these the most useful applications of IoT? Maybe not, but there fun to make.
