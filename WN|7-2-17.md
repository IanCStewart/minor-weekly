Q: Practical tips;
A: what are the main accessibilities problems u want to work on. think about this once document it and people can come back to this. make your own internal guide lines besides your style guide.;

you can’t just change the size/ color off one thing. you will have to change everything in context

Q: what do front-end and visual do wrong;
A: these types of people don’t communicate properly. designers should know what happens technically. Developer should know how design works.;

worst things => developer says it won’t work. designer says ur gonna make it

Q: work flow responsive design;
A: designers code…… (test assumption in real browsers with easy mockup). always start with a small screen (mobile first);

in the browser check where it start to feel wrong. this point will be ur next break point. start sketching this new layout idea. after sketching go to sketch, photoshop or code.

easier for the user = user will do it more

don’t be evil (dark-patterns) be open so people come that really want it

never user twitter to bitch on people

short game vs . long term

developer challenges keep up with the basic layer to quickly adapt to frameworks. never get stuck on abstractions.
designers also should make sure their basics are strong.
